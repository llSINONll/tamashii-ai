#Challenge 1 (Monster Upgrade Inventory)
'''
ðŸ§© Scenario:
Your Monster Lab ðŸ§ª now tracks monster upgrades!
Each monster has a list of upgrades it can unlock.

âœ… Your Task:
Add a new key `"upgrades"` to each monster in the list.
The upgrades should be a list of strings, like:

- Goblin: ["Steel Claws", "Earth Armor"]
- Dragon: ["Inferno Wings", "Blazing Tail"]
- Slime: ["Mega Bounce", "Tsunami Body"]

âœ… Bonus:
After updating the monsters, print out each monster's name
and their list of upgrades.

ðŸŽ¯ Example Output:
Goblin can unlock: ['Steel Claws', 'Earth Armor']
Dragon can unlock: ['Inferno Wings', 'Blazing Tail']
Slime can unlock: ['Mega Bounce', 'Tsunami Body']

#Challenge 2 (Upgrade Finder)
'''
ðŸ§© Scenario:
Now that upgrades are added, you want a quick tool
to see if a monster has a specific upgrade!

âœ… Your Task:
Write a function called has_upgrade(monster, upgrade_name).

The function should:
- Accept a monster dictionary and an upgrade name (string).
- Return True if the upgrade exists in their upgrades list, else False.

âœ… Bonus:
Test the function with a few checks, like:

- Does Goblin have "Steel Claws"? â†’ True
- Does Dragon have "Mega Bounce"? â†’ False

ðŸŽ¯ Example:
has_upgrade(monster, "Steel Claws") â†’ True or False
