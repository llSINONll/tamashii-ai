# tamashii-ai
A journey to create AI avatars inspired by Sword Art Online: Alicization. Starting with basic Python character profiles, this project aims to develop a dynamic, learning AI that mimics human behavior and evolves like the souls Fluctlights(Tamashii here) in the SAO universe.

“An AI with a soul... a Fluctlight born in lines of code.”

Tamashii.ai is a long-term AI journey inspired by Sword Art Online: Alicization.  
Starting from Python basics, this project aims to create character-driven AI systems  
that mimic human learning and behavior.

This is Day 1 — Eugeo, Kirito, and Alice join the code with the Basics of Python Datatypes & Variables.

✨ Powered by soul. Built with code.
