‚úÖ What is Inheritance?
Inheritance allows a class (called a child or subclass) to inherit
properties and methods from another class (called a parent or base class).

eg. 
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Animal speaks")

class Dog(Animal):  # Dog inherits from Animal
    def bark(self):
        print("Dog barks")

d = Dog()
d.speak()  # from Animal
d.bark()   # from Dog
So Dog inherits from Animal and gets all its methods and
attributes unless overridden.

üîç What is Abstraction?
Abstraction is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
It involves hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing
only the essential features to the user. This simplifies interactions with complex
systems by providing a clear and straightforward interface.

In Python, abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and
abstract methods, which are provided by the abc module.

üß∞ Implementing Abstraction in Python
To implement abstraction, you define an abstract
base class using the ABC module and decorate methods
with @abstractmethod. Subclasses then inherit from this
base class and provide concrete implementations of the abstract methods.

üî® How to Implement Abstraction in Python

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Monster(ABC):  # Abstract base class
    @abstractmethod
    def attack(self):
        pass  # No body here ‚Üí this must be implemented by child classes

class Goblin(Monster):
    def attack(self):
        print("Goblin attacks with a club!")

class Dragon(Monster):
    def attack(self):
        print("Dragon breathes fire!")

g = Goblin()
g.attack()

d = Dragon()
d.attack()
Monster is abstract and cannot be instantiated.

Both Goblin and Dragon must implement attack() ‚Äî that's the power
of abstraction: enforcing a contract.

#Challenge_1 (Abstract Monster Blueprint)
'''
üîÆ Scenario:
You‚Äôre now designing a full Monster System using abstraction!

We‚Äôll define a base abstract class Monster that other monsters
will inherit from. Each monster type will have its own attack() method.

‚úÖ Your Tasks:
Create an abstract class Monster with:

name, element, gold

An abstract method: attack(self)

Create 2 subclasses:

Goblin ‚Üí attacks with "Club Smash"

Dragon ‚Üí attacks with "Flame Breath"

Create objects of both and call attack()

üß™ Example Output:

g = Goblin("Grizzle", "Earth")
g.attack()
# Output: Grizzle attacks with Club Smash!

d = Dragon("Inferno", "Fire")
d.attack()
# Output: Inferno attacks with Flame Breath!
'''
'''
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Monster(ABC):
    def __init__(self, name, element):
        self.name = name
        self.element = element
        self.gold = 100

    @abstractmethod
    def attack(self):
        pass

class Goblin(Monster):
    def attack(self):
        print(f"{self.name} attacks with Club Smash!!")

class Dragon(Monster):
    def attack(self):
        print(f"{self.name} attacks with the Flame Breath!!")

g = Goblin("Grizzle", "Earth")
g.attack()

d = Dragon("Inferno", "Fire")
d.attack()
'''

#Challenge_2 (Monster Combat System with Random Damage)
'''
üîÆ Scenario:
Let‚Äôs bring these monsters to life in battle! 
Each monster should now deal random damage when they attack.

‚úÖ Your Tasks:
1. Update the `attack` method in each subclass:

- It should generate a **random damage** value between 10 and 30.
- Print a message including the monster's name, attack type, and the damage dealt.

2. Bonus:
Create a method:
    def take_damage(self, amount):
    - Deducts `amount` from a monster's HP (start all monsters with 100 HP).
    - If HP drops to 0 or below, print: "<name> has been defeated!"

‚úÖ Sample Output:

Grizzle attacks with Club Smash and deals 17 damage!
Inferno attacks with Flame Breath and deals 25 damage!
Grizzle takes 25 damage. HP is now 75.
