#Challenge_1 (Turn-Based Monster Battle)
'''
ðŸ§© Scenario
Your monsters are ready to duel in a full turn-based battle!
Weâ€™ll loop the battle until one monster is defeated.

âœ… Your Challenge:
Extend your previous Monster, Goblin, and Dragon classes.

Now create a battle system like this:

ðŸ§ª Steps to Implement:

while both monsters are alive:
    1. Monster A attacks âž¤ deals damage âž¤ Monster B takes damage
    2. Check if Monster B is defeated
    3. Monster B attacks âž¤ deals damage âž¤ Monster A takes damage
    4. Check if Monster A is defeated
ðŸ“Œ Hints:
Create a method like .is_alive() in base class that returns self.hp > 0

You can use time.sleep(1) to slow the fight for drama ðŸ˜„

Use a while loop and keep the fight going until one monsterâ€™s hp <= 0

ðŸ§ª Example Output:

Inferno attacks with Flame Breath and deals 24 damage!
Grizzle takes 24 damage. HP is now 76

Grizzle attacks with Club Smash and deals 17 damage!
Inferno takes 17 damage. HP is now 83

...

Inferno has been defeated!
