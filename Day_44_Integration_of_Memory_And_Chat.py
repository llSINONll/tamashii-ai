'''
Tamashii Brain v2.5 ‚Äì Memory + Chat Integration (Offline)
We‚Äôll add a very simple offline conversation mode using your stored memory and a few basic responses.
Later we‚Äôll plug in ChatGPT API or LLMs, but today: offline + logic-based replies.

‚úÖ What We‚Äôll Do:
User can say anything

Tamashii checks memory and replies smartly

Replies vary based on:

Keyword in user message

If memory contains related entries

Or general fallback response
