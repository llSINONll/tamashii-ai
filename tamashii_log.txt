Topic: I learned about Variables also datatypes today....
Progress: I created the profiles of characters such as Eugeo, Kirito, Eugeo etc.. and what i learned new is that about f"" formatted strings 
Reflection: I'm feeling good to start even a small project first to learn basics and then i'll implement these basics to the goal project of mine to make a real tamashii.ai which can learn just like humans in a dynamic environment not just by dataset but by reinforcement learning like humans do...

Topic: I've learned about Conditionals and Loops today!!!
Progress: I created a lot of interesting challenge's program that was so fun and i learned new things too!! like proper looping through dictionary and all
Reflection: I'm feeling like yes i can do that if i can do it here then surely i will made the AI Tamashii(Soul) that can learn like us Humans!!!

Topic: I learned about the functions in python today that is used for reusing the codes and it was really convenient isn't it??
Progress: I created a lot of things in the challenges like character profile maker and potions, mana tracker and all it was reallyy funn!!
Reflection: I felt like yes i can do it even if it is rn in the basic level but everyone have to start from somewhere isn't it?? so yeahh that is my basic point but someday i'll make the AI that can learn just like us humans so stay tuned!!! ><

Topic: I've learnt about the Non primitive data types like List, Tuple and Dictionary by that we can group the elements...
Progress: I created a character profile by dictionary, Inventory manager using list and Stat Booster using tuple and learned to loop through a list of dictionaries it was fun
Reflection: i really like to do those tasks and love it soon i'll be a intermediate Ai engineer and will make the Ai that can learn like a human soon.. just wait and watch!!!

Topic: I've learnt about a lot of things today like Advanced concepts of string, lists ops and many more...
Progress: I've created a character team builder kind of thing in a secret challenge and also did some other stuffs in another challenges like remove duplicates from a list and file reading stuffs it was fun..
Reflection: I'm feeling like even it is kind of complex i get it too if i really try to look into it and yeahhh it was fun will make the tamashii.ai in reality someday...>< till then see ya~

Topic: I've learnt about that how to handle the dictionaries inside the list ... and it was fun really..!!
Progress: I've created Monster Hunte Inventory Updater, Monster Skill Updater and mainly an Inventory Merger!! and it was complex but good to make indeed...
Reflection: I'm feeling like i can do it even if it is complex or not to the point but will achieve what i want!! i.e. tamashii.ai!!!
