    "Inferno Cape": 50,
    "Stone Boots": 20
}
Write a function:

#Challenge 2: Monster Tournament Bracket
'''
Scenario:
In this challenge, youâ€™re organizing a monster battle tournament.
Monsters will face off one-on-one, and only the winner advances
to the next round until thereâ€™s one final champion left!

Your Tasks:
Pair up monsters for each round.

Determine the winner based on their power and elemental advantages.

Reward the winner with +20 gold and the loser with +10 gold after each battle.

If thereâ€™s an odd number of monsters, one monster gets a
free pass to the next round.

Repeat the process until only one monster remains!

Power Calculation:
Abilities: Each ability = +10 power.

Elemental Advantage: Based on the rules you already know:

Water beats Fire.

Fire beats Earth.

Earth beats Water.

Gold Reward:
Winner gets +20 gold.

Loser gets +10 gold.
