#Challenge 1: Monster Tech Tree Upgrade System
'''
ðŸ§© Scenario:
Each monster can now upgrade specific abilities with a new "tech tree" system!
Each ability has multiple upgrade levels, and upgrades cost gold.

âœ… Your Tasks:
Update the monster structure:
Each monster should have:

-Name

-Element

-Gold

-Abilities with levels (dictionary of ability name â†’ level)

Create a function:
def upgrade_ability(monster, ability_name):
If the ability exists, upgrade it by +1

Cost = 20 gold per level

Deduct gold if affordable, else print "Not enough gold!"

Print upgraded level and remaining gold

Bonus Display Function:
def display_monster(monster):
Show name, element, gold, and list of abilities with current levels.

#Challenge 2: Monster Ability Cooldown System
'''
ðŸ§© Scenario:
Now that monsters have powerful abilities,
each ability should have a cooldown â€“
a number of turns it must wait before being used again.

âœ… Your Tasks:
Update monster structure:

Each ability should track both its level and its cooldown counter.

"abilities": {
    "Flame": {"level": 1, "cooldown": 0},
    ...
}
Create a function:

def use_ability(monster, ability_name):
If cooldown is 0:

Print: ability used!

Set cooldown to 3 turns (just an example).

Else:

Print: Ability is on cooldown for X more turns.

Create another function:

def reduce_cooldowns(monster):
Reduce all cooldowns by 1 (to a minimum of 0).

âœ… Bonus:
Show a function display_abilities(monster) that prints all abilities with
level and cooldown left.
